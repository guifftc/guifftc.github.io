About me
=====

I am an evolutionary protistologist. I sample soils, marine and freshwater, to isolate and culture microbial eukaryotes. I morphologically describe protists with light and electron microscopy, I do experiments on whole cultures and single cells to obtain high-quality molecular data (transcriptomes and genomes) to perform environmental surveys, phylogenomics and comparative genomic analyzes.

These interdisciplinary capabilities: classical taxonomy, and state-of-the-art molecular biology and bioinformatics; allow me to improve our understanding of the biodiversity, ecology, and macroevolution of protists.

During my career, I have worked with multiple eukaryotic lineages (opisthokonts, stramenopiles, archaeplastids, and various heterotrophic flagellates: ancyromonads, apusomonads, jakobids, malawimonads, mantamonads), describing 11 new genera and 18 new species, sequencing over 50 strains and robustly placing them in the tree of life.
Along my career, I have gained good knowledge on the still changing backbone of the eukaryotic tree of life, and also about conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses at the deepest parts, at the root of supergroups and the relationships between them.

My long-term goal is to learn the genomic changes that explain current eukaryotic diversity and ecology, and particularly how eukaryotes originated and diversified.
